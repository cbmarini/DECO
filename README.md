# DECO

DECO is a FORM program to enumerate subleading operator bases for effective theories with freely chosen field content and symmetries. The available fields, symmetries and representations encompass the usual SM symmetries and fields, as well as a handful of discrete symmetries, most notably S_4, A_4 and Z_n as well as U(1)_R. The code is highly modular and can easily be adapted to allow for additional symmetry groups and representations, should the demand arise.

DECO was developed by Simon Calo, Coenraad Marinissen and Rudi Rahn. If you use DECO, please cite ...
